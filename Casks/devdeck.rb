# Homebrew Cask for DevDeck.

# This file is the SEED/source-of-truth for the separate tap repo `proshik/homebrew-tap`.
# Copy it there as `Casks/devdeck.rb`. The release workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)
# then rewrites the `version` and `sha256` lines on every release.

  caveats <<~EOS
    DevDeck is not notarized (free distribution). On first launch Gatekeeper may block it
    because Homebrew quarantines downloads. Remove the quarantine flag once:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "#{appdir}/DevDeck.app"

    or right-click the app and choose "Open". Subsequent updates are delivered in-app
    via Sparkle and are not quarantined.
